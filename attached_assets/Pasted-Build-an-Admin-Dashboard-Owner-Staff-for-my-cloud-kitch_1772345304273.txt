Build an Admin Dashboard (Owner + Staff) for my cloud kitchen app “Stones & Spices”.

Goal:
Create a separate, secure dashboard for kitchen owner and staff to manage orders, menu, kitchen open/closed status, inventory, and order tracking. This admin dashboard must not be accessible to regular customers.

Tech/Implementation Requirements:
- Use a production-ready full-stack structure.
- Use a real database (PostgreSQL recommended) with migrations.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) with two roles: OWNER and STAFF.
- Authentication:
  - Separate login/signup page for admin users (staff + owner).
  - Forgot password flow (email-based reset link).
  - “Forgot email” flow: allow the user to recover the login email using phone number OR username + security question (choose one simple method and implement it).
  - Sessions with secure cookies or JWT.
- Build two UIs:
  1) Customer app (existing / not modified much)
  2) Admin dashboard (new, protected routes)

Core Features (Admin Dashboard):

1) Order Management (Main feature)
- Show a live list of all orders with:
  - Order ID
  - Customer name + phone (if available)
  - Items summary (e.g., “3 items”)
  - Total amount
  - Payment status (paid/unpaid if applicable)
  - Order status (see statuses below)
  - Created time
- Staff actions:
  - Accept order / Reject order
  - Once accepted, order status becomes “PREPARING”
- Order status lifecycle:
  - NEW (just placed)
  - ACCEPTED (optional step) / PREPARING
  - READY_FOR_DELIVERY
  - OUT_FOR_DELIVERY
  - DELIVERED
  - COMPLETED
  - REJECTED
  - CANCELLED
- Each order page (click into an order) should show:
  - Customer details
  - Full item list with quantities
  - Notes (optional)
  - Total amount
  - Status timeline
  - Buttons to move order to the next status
- Item-level tracking inside an order:
  - Each item should also have a status:
    - PENDING / PREPARING / DONE
  - Staff can mark each item as DONE
  - Order can only be moved to READY_FOR_DELIVERY after all items are DONE (or provide an override for OWNER only)

2) Kitchen Open / Closed Toggle
- Admin can toggle kitchen status: OPEN or CLOSED.
- If CLOSED:
  - Customer app should show “Kitchen is currently closed” and prevent checkout.
- Show a prominent OPEN/CLOSED badge in admin header.

3) Menu Management (Add/Edit/Availability/Out-of-stock)
- Admin can add new menu items with:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Category (Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Snacks)
  - Price
  - Veg/Non-veg flag
  - Spice level (mild/medium/spicy)
  - Image (optional)
- Each menu item must have:
  - is_available (true/false) to show to users
  - stock_status (IN_STOCK / OUT_OF_STOCK)
- Admin can toggle “Available” and “Out of stock” per item.
- Customer app should reflect:
  - Items out of stock are visible but disabled (or hidden — pick one and implement consistently).
- Menu changes must reflect instantly in customer ordering menu.

4) Separate Orders per Customer + No Confusion
- Orders must be uniquely tracked by Order ID and customer ID.
- Admin list should support:
  - Search by Order ID / customer name / phone
  - Filters by status (NEW, PREPARING, READY, etc.)
  - Sort by time (latest first)

5) Owner-only Analytics & Financial Dashboard
- Only OWNER role can see analytics.
- Analytics page should show:
  - Total orders today / this month / this year
  - Total revenue today / this month / this year
  - Revenue by day (simple chart)
  - Average order value
- Data must be computed from paid/completed orders.
- Staff should NOT see revenue numbers.

6) Admin User Management (Owner only)
- OWNER can:
  - Create staff accounts
  - Disable staff accounts
  - Reset staff password (optional)
- STAFF can only manage orders/menu/status but cannot see financial analytics.

Database Models (create tables & relations):
- AdminUser: id, name, email, password_hash, role (OWNER/STAFF), is_active, created_at
- CustomerUser: id, name, email/phone, created_at
- MenuItem: id, name, description, category, price, is_available, stock_status, veg_flag, spice_level, image_url, created_at, updated_at
- KitchenStatus: id (single row), is_open, updated_at, updated_by_admin_id
- Order: id, customer_id, total_amount, payment_status, status, created_at, updated_at
- OrderItem: id, order_id, menu_item_id, name_snapshot, price_snapshot, qty, item_status, notes

Important UI Pages (Admin):
- /admin/login
- /admin/signup (or owner creates staff; you choose better and implement)
- /admin/forgot-password
- /admin/dashboard (orders list)
- /admin/orders/:id (order detail + item-level statuses)
- /admin/menu (menu items list + toggles + add/edit form)
- /admin/kitchen-status (open/closed toggle)
- /admin/analytics (OWNER only)
- /admin/staff-management (OWNER only)

Permissions:
- STAFF: orders, menu, kitchen open/close
- OWNER: everything including analytics + staff management

Quality Requirements:
- Clean UI (simple but professional dashboard layout)
- Validation and clear error messages
- No duplicate orders, no race conditions on status update
- Use server-side authorization checks (not only UI hiding)

Deliverables:
- Full working code with DB migrations
- Seed script for sample menu items + one owner account
- README with setup and deployment steps
